# arduino-pilot
This project is for UI Drone Zone in order to create a remote controlled
airplane using Arduino.

The project is based on the inputs of two dual-axis potentiometers being
sent from an Arduino-Uno to an Arduino Pro-mini over XRF transceivers at
868 MHz. The Pro-mini uses this information to adjust the rudder and
elevators using servo's and adjust the speed of the motor spinning the
propeller.

The code in this project is based on:
